_This is a listing for the RWOT7 papers to date. [Several more](https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot7/blob/master/draft-documents/README.md) are in process._

## [*How to Convince Dad\* of the Importance of Self-Sovereign Identity*](https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot7/blob/master/final-documents/convincing-dad.pdf) [(Text)](https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot7/blob/master/final-documents/convincing-dad.md)

> One of the major problems with bootstrapping self-sovereign identity is that it requires adoption by a large number of people. Pushing self-sovereign identity from the top-down is most likely to result in a technology thatâ€™s not actually used, but instead encouraging the average person to demand self-sovereign identity from the bottom-up will result in the organic development of a vibrant, well-utilized decentralized web-of-trust ecosystem.

> This paper addresses that need by offering arguments to a variety of people who might be reluctant to use self-sovereign identity, uninterested in its possibilities, or oblivious to the dangers of centralization. By focusing on the needs of real people, we hope to also encourage developers, engineers, and software business owners to create the apps that will address their reluctance and fulfill their needs, making self-sovereign identity a reality.

## [*Peer to Peer Degrees of Trust*](https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot7/blob/master/final-documents/peer-to-peer-degrees-of-trust.pdf) [(Text)](https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot7/blob/master/final-documents/peer-to-peer-degrees-of-trust.md)

> Aunthenticity is a challenge for any identity solution. In the physical world, at least in America, it is not difficult to change one's identity. In the digital world, there is the problem of bots. The botnet detection market is expected to be worth over one billion USD by 2023, in a landscape where most digital activity is still heavily centralized. These centralized digital solutions have the advantage of being able to track IP addresses, request phone verification, and present CAPTCHAs to users in order to authenticate them. If this problem is so difficult to solve in the centralized world, how much more challenging will it be in the decentralized world, where none of these techniques are available?

> In this paper, we explore the idea of using a web of trust as a tool to add authenticity to decentralized identifiers (DIDs). We define a framework for deriving relative trust degrees using a given trust metric: a "trustworthiness" score for a given identity from the perspective of another identity. It is our intent that this framework may be used as a starting point for an ongoing exploration of graph-based, decentralized trust. We believe this approach may ultimately be used as a foundation for decentralized reputation.

## [*Resource Integrity Proofs*](https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot7/blob/master/final-documents/resource-integrity-proofs.pdf) [(Text)](https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot7/blob/master/final-documents/resource-integrity-proofs.md)

> Currently, the Web provides a simple yet powerful mechanism for the dissemination of information via links. Unfortunately, there is no generalized mechanism that enables verifying that a fetched resource has been delivered without unexpected manipulation. Would it be possible to create an extensible and multipurpose cryptographic link that provides discoverability, integrity, and scheme agility?

> This paper proposes a linking solution that decouples integrity information from link and resource syntaxes, enabling verification of any representation of a resource from any type of link. We call this approach Resource Integrity Proofs (RIPs). RIPs provide a succinct way to link to resources with cryptographically verifiable content integrity. RIPs can be combined with blockchain technology to create discoverable proofs of existence to off-chain resources.
